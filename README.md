# Feng, Xinyu

Master's student in Plant Protection at Shandong Agricultural University, China.

My research focuses on molecular plant-pathogen interactions, particularly RxLR effector biology and plant innate immunity. I'm currently investigating how the RxLR645 effector from *Phytophthora capsici* modulates chili pepper immunity.

## Research Interests

- Molecular mechanisms of plant-oomycete interactions
- RxLR effector biology and plant innate immunity
- Host defense signaling and induced resistance in vegetable crops
- Integrated and sustainable disease management strategies
